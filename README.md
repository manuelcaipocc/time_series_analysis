# Time Series Analysis – Universität Ulm

Repository for coursework and exercises developed during the **Time Series Analysis** module of the *M.Sc. Computational Science and Engineering* program at **Universität Ulm**.

---

## Overview

This module covers the **modelling and statistical analysis of discrete-time stochastic processes**, focusing on the study of **time series** using statistical software (particularly **R**). Students learn to classify models, fit and analyze data, and perform prediction tasks for real-world applications.
